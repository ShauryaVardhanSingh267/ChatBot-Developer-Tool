# ChatBot Developer Tool 

A Java-based **ChatBot Developer Tool** that can generate chatbot programs automatically.  
This was my **largest and most complex coding project** during high school, combining my self-study of **AP Computer Science A (APCSA)** with my growing interest in **AI and chatbots**.

---

## üåü Project Background  

- At my school, **AP courses were not offered** and even the concept of AP exams was largely unknown.  
- I took the **initiative to self-study APCSA** completely on my own, learning topics **before they were taught in my national curriculum**.  
- For example, **ArrayLists** are not even part of my Grade 12 syllabus, yet I studied them deeply while preparing for APCSA.  

During this process, I discovered topics like **Twitter Sentiment Analysis algorithms** and the importance of **stop word removal** in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

At the same time, with the global rise of ChatGPT, I had been reading extensively about **rule-based chatbots**. Suddenly, both these areas connected ‚Äî and I realized I could write a program that not only behaves like a chatbot but also **generates chatbot programs for others**.  

After **2‚Äì3 days of continuous effort**, I built this project: a fully functional Java program that **creates chatbots automatically**.

## ‚ö° Features  

- **Chatbot Code Generator**: The program outputs Java chatbot code automatically.  
- **Rule-Based Responses**: Uses basic NLP techniques like keyword matching (inspired by sentiment analysis and stop words).  
- **Extensible Design**: Developers can customize responses and expand functionality.  
- **Multiple Chatbots Included**: Repository contains:
  - The **main developer tool** (133 lines of code).  
  - **3 example chatbots** generated using this tool.

## üìÇ Repository Structure  

- **ChatBotDeveloperTool.java**:         Main program that generates chatbot code
- **ChatBot1.java**:                     Example chatbot generated by the tool
- **ChatBot2.java**:                     Example chatbot generated by the tool
- **ChatBot3.java**:                     Example chatbot generated by the tool

---

## üöÄ How It Works  

1. Run the **ChatBotDeveloperTool.java** program.  
2. Provide chatbot name and responses through prompts.  
3. The tool generates a **new Java file** containing a fully functional chatbot.  
4. Compile and run the generated chatbot ‚Äî it‚Äôs ready to interact!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Java (APCSA level + beyond)  
- **Concepts Used:**  
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Arrays & ArrayLists  
  - String manipulation  
  - Basic NLP concepts (keywords, stop words)  

---

## üéØ Why This Project Matters  

This project represents:  

- **Initiative & Self-Learning**: Self-studied APCSA without formal guidance.  
- **Exploration Beyond Curriculum**: Applied concepts not covered in school, like ArrayLists & sentiment analysis.  
- **Problem-Solving**: Connected chatbot fundamentals with NLP ideas to create something original.  
- **Persistence**: Spent several days iterating until the program was fully functional.  

It‚Äôs not just a chatbot tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **milestone in my coding journey**.  

---

## üìå Future Plans  

- Expand to a **web-based version** with a polished front-end.  
- Add support for **machine learning models** for smarter responses.  
- Release as an **open-source chatbot creation tool** for students & developers.
